LEVELS

0 Easy Start
1 Feldschloesschen
	Soon after defeating the blimp miniboss, there will be a big blue crate
that throws out exploding bottles.  Watch out for the brown shards, and turn up
the brightness of your monitor if necessary.  When the crate rises from the
bottom of the screen, stay away from the bottom of the screen where the green
bottles will rush in, watching out for the looping bottle on the left and its
homing shot.  The centre left is a good place to be.

	The two end bosses are quite hard.  When there are two crates on either
side throwing out exploding bottles, try to stay close to the blue crates,
dodge down for each shard and get back up as soon as possible.	Once you have
destroyed one of the crates, take a path to the other side in the upper half of
the screen so that the shards will be coming from below.  It is easier to dodge
shards coming at you if they are coming from above or below because the Eichhof
bottle is narrower than it is tall.  A fairly fool-proof way is to have
selected the Pony weapon and to shoot the exploding bottles with Eichhof while
shooting the crates with the Pony.  If all else fails, try to stay alive long
enough for the final boss to appear.  When you die again, you will skip
straight to the final boss.
	Destroy one of the small blue crates first, then move to the other
side.  Watch out for the large, slow round white missiles that are aimed at
you.  You should try either to be high up at the sides or near the bottom
at centre when they are released, but avoid the corners.


2 Weissbier
	When going past the exploding barrels, try to remember which ones you
have shot the most to anticipate which will explode first.
	For final boss, start at the bottom right of the screen. Then move to
the top right and let the row of beers shoot underneath you.  Then back to the
bottom right.  Circle round the boss to the bottom left, avoiding the arc of
small bottles it shoots out.

3 No More Cocktails
	For the final three bosses, circle around whichever one is on the
bottom right.

4 The Morning After
	Spend any left-over money on extra lives.
	The part where two toilets appear at the bottom left and spit out
bottles is very hard.  There will be two runs of green bottles.  The first
will go up slightly before reaching the right of the screen and the second
will go up along the right edge before circling round the top.  Position
yourself in between them.
	When navigating the field of flying toasters, don't fire your weapons.
This will avoid the counter-shots when each toaster is destroyed.  After that,
watch out for the two shots spat high out the top of the small pink cup.
This cup takes a lot of damage but is easy to ignore.  You can sometimes duck
between the cup and its shots.  It will go off screen
by itself eventually.
	Immediately after there are three exploding apple cores coming at you,
wait for the alarm clocks to appear at the right side of the screen.  Then
position yourself under the bottom one.  This should allow you to destroy them
quickly and avoid their shots.
The bottom
right of the screen is a good place to be for the second phase of the final
boss to dodge targeted shots and destroy the spawned alarm clocks.


General advice:

If you cannot catch an enemy up because they are moving the same speed as you,
try moving towards them to give your bullets time to catch up.

Position your ship in anticipation of homing shots so they will go where you
want to make them easy to dodge.  Honing shots aim towards the top (the bottle
cap) of your main weapon.  Therefore the top left and top right of the screen
are good places for them to go.
